# toy-payment-engine
Building a toy payment engine to learn more about Rust.

## Development
So far this tool can just read a csv file in as input. I've included a test input file for debugging purposes. Run the following commands from the root directory to test.

- `cargo build` to build the code
- `./target/debug/toy-payment-engine test_input.csv` to run the engine with the test input csv as input
